# cvs_migration
This is my repository for tests to migrate my CVS project. DO NOT FORK, IT WILL BE DELETED AGAIN!

The source repository will be my project as of http://sourceforge.net/projects/lbdmf/.
Within that project the CVS repository contains a HEAD branch and a second where I currently work.
The second branch is Release_1_0_4_stable_rc1_branch.

I think, there were at all 4 users editing on the project.

I want to plan and setup a migration script that contains the commands for conversion. This repo is therefore
the preparation project targeting another repo.

Some reading:
http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2git.html, 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/881158/is-there-a-migration-tool-from-cvs-to-git

Any help is appreciated.
